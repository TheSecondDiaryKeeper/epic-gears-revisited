# Epic Gears: Revisited
The Epic Gears Pack, one of the most widely beloved mods in Unturned's history. Most modded servers have tussled with this mod at least once, but one thing about the original pack is it always had a lack of balance. It never really struck it out of the park. Well no longer. This updated rendition of the Epic Gears Pack has everything balanced, usable, viable, and working. Some things have been removed, some things have been tweaked, and some things have been reworked entirely. Today I present the third installment of the Epic Gears Pack, "Epic Gears: Revisited".

I plan to update this mod frequently, and fix it regularly if it ever breaks.

Edit: I decided to take a "short" hiatus from the Unturned scene, so I may not actively be able to test this mod every patch. If a patch comes around and breaks it/something stops working as intended please comment it here or
